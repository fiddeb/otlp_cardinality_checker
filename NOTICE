Log Template Extraction

The automatic log template extraction feature implements the Drain algorithm
as described in the following academic paper:

  "Drain: An Online Log Parsing Approach with Fixed Depth Tree"
  Pinjia He, Jieming Zhu, Zibin Zheng, and Michael R. Lyu
  IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS), 2017
  https://jiemingzhu.github.io/pub/pjhe_icws2017.pdf

This is an independent implementation based on the published algorithm.

HyperLogLog

The cardinality estimation feature uses the HyperLogLog algorithm as
described in:

Development Process

This project uses OpenSpec for change management and specification-driven
development. Proposals, designs, and task tracking are maintained in the
openspec/ directory.

Portions of this codebase were developed with AI coding assistants
(GitHub Copilot, Claude). All AI-generated code has been reviewed,
tested, and approved by the project maintainers.
